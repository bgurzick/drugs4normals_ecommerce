Current Status - 07 July 2024
- started this project before I learned REACT and component-based structure, so now I'm going to redo it to make it more dynamic, responsive, etc.

General Idea: Drugs4Normals
- The name: Music provides emotional resonance, release, and involuntary joy and movement. It acts on both sides of the brain and becomes embedded in neural pathways in such a way that even those with serious brain injury are often able to recall melodies from long ago.

- The business: Music streaming services are an abuse of the arts. With my limited reach (and presumed limited appeal), I would make more money from a single sale on my own website than years on Sp*tify or similar services. I would prefer to maintain ownership and control of my art and my business.

- More about the business: Any purchaser will have lifetime digital access to all current and future projects. After the initial purchase, they can choose to buy physical media, if so desired.

- Additional consideration: Most music listeners use streaming services - there's no way around that. But here's how I might try to make my own space: 
    - creating my own mobile application for listening, which enables me to upload new music seamlessly and would also allow me to add other local artists to create a small, local music community
    - adding music to preferred streaming services only once business targets have been reached
    - providing purchase coupons for preferred music players / streaming services


Future Plans
- most future plans have more to do with business and e-commerce design, rather than programming, but I will continue to post updates as progress is made.
